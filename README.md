SQL Data Analysis Project: Customer & Sales Insights
Welcome to my first data analysis project! 🚀 This project was developed as part of my professional training to demonstrate my ability to transform raw data into actionable business insights using SQL.

📌 About the Project
The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and generate business-ready reports for a retail dataset. I worked with a schema consisting of a Fact table (fact_sales) and Dimension tables (dim_customers, dim_products) to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) and customer behavior.

Key Highlights:

First Milestone: This is my debut project in the field of Data Analytics.

Course Work: Developed during my SQL bootcamp to practice real-world database querying and reporting.

Advanced Logic: Includes customer segmentation, product performance ranking, and time-series analysis.

🛠 Tech Stack
Database: SQL Server (T-SQL)

Key Techniques: * Advanced Joins and Aggregations.

Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, SUM OVER).

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for modular code.

Database Views for automated reporting.

Here is a professional and engaging README.md in English. I have structured it to highlight your technical skills while clearly stating that this is your first milestone project from your course.

📈 Analysis Overview
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identified customer demographics across different countries.

Determined the business timespan (first and last order dates).

Calculated high-level KPIs: Total Sales, Total Quantity, Average Price, and Total Orders.

2. Customer & Sales Intelligence
Segmentation: Categorized customers into VIP, Regular, and New based on their spending habits and loyalty lifespan.

Demographics: Analyzed sales distribution by gender, age groups, and geographic location.

Monthly Performance: Tracked sales trends and calculated running totals using window functions.

3. Product Performance
Ranking: Identified the Top 5 best-selling and Worst 5 performing products.

YoY Analysis: Compared current yearly sales against the previous year (PY) and calculated the percentage change.

Category Insights: Analyzed which categories contribute most to the overall revenue.

4. Final Business Reports
I developed two comprehensive reporting structures:

Customer Report: Consolidates metrics like recency, frequency, and average monthly spend.

Product Report: A specialized View providing insights into product segments (High-Performer vs. Low-Performer) and average order revenue.

📂 File Structure
04_data_analysis_SQL.sql: Contains the full SQL script, organized from basic exploration to advanced reporting views.

💡 Reflection
As my first project, this was a fantastic opportunity to move beyond simple queries and understand how data helps businesses make strategic decisions. I learned how to handle null values, use complex logic for segmentation, and optimize code for readability.
