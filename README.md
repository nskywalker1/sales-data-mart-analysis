# 📊 SQL Data Analysis Project: Customer & Sales Insights

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to my first major project in Data Analytics! This project was developed as part of my SQL course to demonstrate my ability to extract, transform, and analyze data to solve real-world business problems. 

I performed a full-cycle **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a retail dataset, focusing on customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Skills
* **SQL Server (T-SQL):** The primary tool used for querying and analysis.
* **Advanced Joins:** Connecting Fact and Dimension tables (`fact_sales`, `dim_customers`, `dim_products`).
* **Window Functions:** Used `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `LAG`, and `OVER` for rankings and YoY analysis.
* **CTEs & Views:** Created modular, readable code and automated reports.
* **Data Segmentation:** Applied complex `CASE` logic for customer and product profiling.

## 📈 Key Analysis Features

### 1. Business KPI Discovery
* Calculated foundational metrics: **Total Sales, Total Orders, Average Price,** and **Customer Base** size.
* Determined the operational timespan and customer age demographics.

### 2. Customer Intelligence & Segmentation
* **Customer Profiling:** Classified customers into **VIP**, **Regular**, and **New** based on their spending history and tenure (lifespan).
* **Demographics:** Analyzed sales by country and gender to identify the most profitable segments.
* **Engagement:** Tracked "Recency" to see how many months have passed since a customer's last purchase.

### 3. Sales & Product Performance
* **Trend Analysis:** Created a monthly sales performance report with **Running Totals**.
* **Year-over-Year (YoY):** Compared current yearly sales against the previous year (PY) to track growth or decline.
* **Product Ranking:** Identified the Top 5 revenue generators and the Worst 5 performing products.
* **Category Insights:** Calculated the percentage contribution of each product category to total revenue.

## 📂 Project Structure
* **EDA Section:** Initial data exploration to understand the database schema.
* **Advanced Analytics:** In-depth SQL queries using CTEs for business logic.
* **Final Reporting:** * `Customer Report`: A comprehensive summary of customer KPIs.
    * `Product Report (View)`: A reusable SQL View for monitoring product health.

## 💡 Learning Journey
This project marks my first milestone in becoming a Data Analyst. It taught me how to:
1. Translate business questions into SQL queries.
2. Clean and handle data (filtering nulls and managing dates).
3. Think like an analyst by focusing on metrics that drive decisions.
